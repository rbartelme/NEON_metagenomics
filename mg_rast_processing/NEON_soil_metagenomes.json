metagenome sequences (DP1.10107). The goal of the NEON soil microbial metagenomic sequencing project is to track changes in the diversity, composition, and functional potential of microbiota in soil ecosystems through space and time. NEON collects surface soil samples to 30 cm depth from numerous sites distributed across the United States.
